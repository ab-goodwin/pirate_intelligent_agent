## Pirate Intelligent Agent

#### Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
##### - In this project, I implemented a deep Q-learning algorithm to train a pirate agent to navigate a maze and find treasure before the player. The goal was to develop an intelligent agent that could solve a pathfinding problem by learning strategies through reinforcement learning. The initial code that was provided are two pre-built Python classes: TreasureMaze.py, which defined a maze environment, and GameExperience.py, which managed experience replay. My task was to complete the Q-learning training process in a Jupyter notebook by implementing the deep Q-learning algorithm. This allowed the pirate agent to learn from its environment and maximize rewards over time.

#### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
##### - This project connects to a broader field of computer science by demonstrating how reinforcement learning, and machine learning can be applied to real challenges. At its core, computer scientists develop algorithms and models that enable machines to make decisions, automate tasks, and learn from experience. This work is important because AI driven systems have the potential to improve decision making in complex environments, from robotics to autonomous driving. Through this project, I’ve increased my understanding of Artificial Intelligence, neural networks, and optimizing models for efficiency, and using a method of training for the presented problem.

#### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
##### - Thinking like a computer scientist means to break problems down into manageable parts and use systematic, logical reasoning. For this project, I started by figuring out the environment and agent structure, then took care of the Q-learning algorithm step by step. I used key machine learning concepts, like the exploration-exploitation to help the agent efficiently learn the optimal path. Testing and refining the model were crucial parts of the process, allowing me to slowly and iteratively improve the agent's performance.

#### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
##### - It’s important to ensure that the AI models and algorithms are fair, transparent, and free from bias, building trust and delivering reliable products. In this project, fairness in AI design meant making sure the pirate agent’s learning process wasn’t skewed toward specific paths and that it could generalize well across different environments. in all projects, I have to keep in mind the privacy and safety implications of AI systems, ensuring that user data and interactions with AI are protected and aligned with ethical standards.
